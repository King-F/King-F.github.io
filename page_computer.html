<p>Never thought you'd be visiting inside your own computer, did you?.<br> Did you know that there are many tiny, tiny parts inside your PC, Mac or laptop that all work together to make sure you can gain access to the immesurable knowledge of the internet.<br> Computers have their own language as well: we call it binary. <br>You have probably experienced a problem where your computer all of a sudden starts showing a long list of zeroes and ones that you can't make heads or tails of. <br> This is what your computer sees as language: the order of '0' and '1' translates to letters of programming code that the computer understands. <br> And it isn't even that hard to learn! <br> After all, there are only two letters in the binary alphabet ;) </p>
